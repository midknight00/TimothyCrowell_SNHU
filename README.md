Project 2 Airgead Banking app

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a simple banking app that can calculate investment data based on user input. There are two projections calculated from those inputs, and both are output for the user. This program involved creating and using C++ objects.

What did you do particularly well?

In this assignment something I did well on was the object orienting aspect of the assignment. I feel as though I created good objects with good functionality for the program. At first, making objects was difficult because of the various separate files involved and the syntax for each one, but after doing a few I was able to quickly grasp the concept.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

After finishing the course and revisiting this project, something that I would change is the main function. It currently has more code than is necessary, and could benefit from a few supporting functions. Another improvement I would make is with the getch() statement. The idea behind this was to allow for the program to automatically continue, but I wasn't able to get the program to recognize input from the user.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Something that I found challenging with this project, and with others is the IDE and importing libraries. Specifically with eclipse I struggled to get the program to recognize many of the libraries that I wanted to use, and was unable to remove errors because of this. Oftentimes I would use simple online compilers to test and edit code, but I want to learn how to use IDEs properly. One way I've thought of to accomplish this is to find online tutorials and to follow videos.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Creating objects with C++ is more involved than with other languages Iâ€™ve worked with. Objects are a cornerstone of most programming languages and I feel it is an essential skill to master. With this project I have raised my understanding of objects, not just for C++, but also in general.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

With this program, as with all programs I write, I use proper variable names and comments. Writing code that is easy to read and understand is an incredibly important aspect of being a programmer. Writing clean code cuts down on time and management, and it streamlines the process for anyone who works on that code.
