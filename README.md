Project 2 Airgead Banking app

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a simple banking app that can calculate investment data based on user input. There are two projections calculated from those inputs, and both are output for the user. This program involved creating and using C++ objects.

What did you do particularly well?

In this assignment something I did well on was the object orienting aspect of the assignment. I feel as though I created good objects with good functionality for the program. At first, making objects was difficult because of the various separate files involved and the syntax for each one, but after doing a few I was able to quickly grasp the concept.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

After finishing the course and revisiting this project, something that I would change is the main function. It currently has more code than is necessary, and could benefit from a few supporting functions. Another improvement I would make is with the getch() statement. The idea behind this was to allow for the program to automatically continue, but I wasn't able to get the program to recognize input from the user.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Something that I found challenging with this project, and with others is the IDE and importing libraries. Specifically with eclipse I struggled to get the program to recognize many of the libraries that I wanted to use, and was unable to remove errors because of this. Oftentimes I would use simple online compilers to test and edit code, but I want to learn how to use IDEs properly. One way I've thought of to accomplish this is to find online tutorials and to follow videos.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Creating objects with C++ is more involved than with other languages I’ve worked with. Objects are a cornerstone of most programming languages and I feel it is an essential skill to master. With this project I have raised my understanding of objects, not just for C++, but also in general.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

With this program, as with all programs I write, I use proper variable names and comments. Writing code that is easy to read and understand is an incredibly important aspect of being a programmer. Writing clean code cuts down on time and management, and it streamlines the process for anyone who works on that code.

The Gaming Room 

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The Gaming Room client wanted to create a game that would work on multiple operating systems. We created a cloud-based system and made the game cross-platform compatible. One of the things that went well with development was security. It was easy to apply concepts like the principle of least privilege. The document was helpful in laying out requirements and ideas in a well-thought-out and sophisticated manner. One thing that would have made things a little simpler is if there was a backlog included showing the progress of the tasks worked on. The client itself meets customer needs by requiring less hardware than a traditional platform because we used a cloud-based system. Many tools were available to help create and maintain the cloud-based platform, such as restful and other types of architectures. In the future, I plan to continue using architectures, APIs, and other tools to help me succeed in the development and production of software.

SDLC

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

This document is a sprint review and retrospective for a vacation booking app. User stories are created from interviews with customers and consumers and provide insight into the functions and features desired by them. Stories are then translated into tasks on the backlog to be developed by the team. Agile has many great practices and processes for development. Some that stand out to me are the product backlog, daily stand up, and sprint review. Being a good team member means supporting your team by accomplishing the tasks you set out to do, and communication. Communication is the most important as one miscommunication can potentially derail the project. 

CS 255 Systems Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Our client DriverPass requested a system to book driving lesson reservations. This could be done online, or through the provided contact number.

What did you do particularly well?

Something that went really well with this project was determining the various requirements needed. I feel as though many of the technical and functional requirements I provided were relevant and necessary for the system, taking into account the needs of the customer.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one thing that I really wanted was for my use case diagram to be more streamlined. I feel as though all of the information was necessary, but I struggled to organize it into a clean presentation. Next time I’ll take more time to order and rearrange the diagram to look neater.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting customer needs is an important part of designing any system. Particularly with DriverPass, we had a meeting and asked questions, and created a transcript. This was extremely helpful for creating system requirements. If a system doesn’t have what the client needs, It can’t be used as intended and is of little value.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

System design is an important part of creating a system because it dictates the growth and direction of development. Gathering requirements and the methods of gathering them are useful tools in addition to the design documents that give a visual representation of how the system should work.

CS 305 Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a company that managed financial accounts and had a cloud-based system that needed security. We provided secure communications and data encryption.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Finding vulnerabilities was difficult, but the dependency check made it easier. Secure code provides safety for customers and companies against breaches and data misuse. Lots of harm can be done to an unprotected system, and companies have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment for their customers.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Finding and identifying vulnerabilities was difficult, but as stated, the dependency check report made it simple to determine what needed to be looked at. Sometimes I had trouble determining false positives, but I did manage to learn to suppress them.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques? What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Adding message signing with SHA-256 and creating a certificate can be applied to any web-based system. Both of these techniques should be used as applicable. Standard coding and security should be observed for all future development.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran tests on the code and looked at examples for similar errors. Running the dependency check also showed new dependencies, but none were added by my refactoring.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

From this project, I would like to demonstrate the ability to add encryption algorithms and the ability to create certificates. I would also like to show my ability to refactor a codebase to determine and deal with vulnerabilities within a system.\

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by applying software testing techniques such as code coverage and unit testing. Testing involves detecting and dealing with defects and possibly unwanted effects within developed code. When testing, testing every possible aspect of the code would theoretically attain one hundred percent code coverage, however this is fundamentally impossible and becomes a huge strain on resources. It is recommended to achieve roughly seventy percent for maximum benefit. Unit testing involves testing small modular aspects of code and making sure that the code is meeting the requirements it’s supposed to. This ensures that the code functions as expected while being able to meet the users and customers needs. Designing software should be a modulare process. Building code in chunks allows them to be adapted as necessary for future development later. These sets of code are more accurate and less time consuming to use because they have already been used to meet requirements.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I have gained a greater understanding and grasp of 3D mesh creation and modeling. I followed a modular design approach that allowed me to change and adjust sections of code as needed. Modular code allows programs to function better with less effort spent on creation and functionality and more focus on implementation. For my scene, There was a lot of 3-Dimensional space calculation that was new to me. Learning how to arrange points of a plane into code was slightly challenging. Iteration was used for the render loop, always checking and redrawing the scene each tick of the render loop. I now have a stronger grasp of graphical aspects and how they interact with each other in a scene. If in the future I am working with graphical components, I hope that learning about movement, lighting, texturing, and the three dimensional space will be useful to me.

CS 340 Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

For software developers, a large part of development is making sure that the code can be used to the fullest in the most efficient way. Part of the way we do this is by creating modular code. Modular code can be used and adapted to many programs easily and quickly. An example of this is how each part of the CRUD operations is handled by its own method. With the CRUD Python module, any combination of crud operations can be run independently of one another. If I just needed a program that can create database entries, this module can be applied to the program to do just that.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In addition to building programs to be modular, it also helps to develop in a modular manner. I start with the base components, what's going to be working directly with the data. I then develop each function separately and then put them together for testing. After that we move to the next level, the client/server level. At this point, the main program should be ready to be integrated into the client/server host. Developing like this makes it easy to find and fix mistakes and errors.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do many things that it would be impossible to list them all off. In today's society everything has been enhanced by technology and computers. Even farmers use incredibly advanced high tech to mow their fields. Without computer scientists there to facilitate the growth and creation of computers, our current world would fall apart. As powerful as software and technology is, it can be used to create immense harm or damage. Developers have a responsibility to provide safe software for clients and users and to protect them from malicious acts.


CS 360 Mobile Architect and Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

Event app is a calendar app that tracks the user's events.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app has three pages, a login screen, main events screen, and a preferences screen. The login screen is simple and allows users to create a login if they don’t have one. The events screen is laid out in a neat grid with buttons on the left for changing events, and an add button on the bottom. The preferences screen is a simple list with a few options. I think my design was fairly successful, but was by no means perfect.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When developing software I take a modular approach, designing one aspect at a time then testing. This allows integration of new features to be smooth and simple. All projects should be completed this way as it promotes strong modular code that is free of errors. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Testing is important because it reveals mistakes and defects in code. Testing as you go along makes it easy to determine what is creating the problem and thus takes less time and energy to fix. When testing my app, I got a strange error where the app would launch then immediately close.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
	
There were many times during development that I had to overcome a challenge. One of the biggest was with getting the buttons to handle the data there assigned to. Each button had its own method that requested specific information from the database.
	
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the best part of my app is the design layout. I spent a long time structuring and nesting layouts so they would look good and compliment each other. I think there is always room for growth and improvement, and one specific area of the design that needed more work was the app bar.
