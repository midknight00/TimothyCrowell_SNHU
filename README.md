Project 2 Airgead Banking app

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a simple banking app that can calculate investment data based on user input. There are two projections calculated from those inputs, and both are output for the user. This program involved creating and using C++ objects.

What did you do particularly well?

In this assignment something I did well on was the object orienting aspect of the assignment. I feel as though I created good objects with good functionality for the program. At first, making objects was difficult because of the various separate files involved and the syntax for each one, but after doing a few I was able to quickly grasp the concept.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

After finishing the course and revisiting this project, something that I would change is the main function. It currently has more code than is necessary, and could benefit from a few supporting functions. Another improvement I would make is with the getch() statement. The idea behind this was to allow for the program to automatically continue, but I wasn't able to get the program to recognize input from the user.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Something that I found challenging with this project, and with others is the IDE and importing libraries. Specifically with eclipse I struggled to get the program to recognize many of the libraries that I wanted to use, and was unable to remove errors because of this. Oftentimes I would use simple online compilers to test and edit code, but I want to learn how to use IDEs properly. One way I've thought of to accomplish this is to find online tutorials and to follow videos.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Creating objects with C++ is more involved than with other languages I’ve worked with. Objects are a cornerstone of most programming languages and I feel it is an essential skill to master. With this project I have raised my understanding of objects, not just for C++, but also in general.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

With this program, as with all programs I write, I use proper variable names and comments. Writing code that is easy to read and understand is an incredibly important aspect of being a programmer. Writing clean code cuts down on time and management, and it streamlines the process for anyone who works on that code.

The Gaming Room 

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The Gaming Room client wanted to create a game that would work on multiple operating systems. We created a cloud-based system and made the game cross-platform compatible. One of the things that went well with development was security. It was easy to apply concepts like the principle of least privilege. The document was helpful in laying out requirements and ideas in a well-thought-out and sophisticated manner. One thing that would have made things a little simpler is if there was a backlog included showing the progress of the tasks worked on. The client itself meets customer needs by requiring less hardware than a traditional platform because we used a cloud-based system. Many tools were available to help create and maintain the cloud-based platform, such as restful and other types of architectures. In the future, I plan to continue using architectures, APIs, and other tools to help me succeed in the development and production of software.

SDLC

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

This document is a sprint review and retrospective for a vacation booking app. User stories are created from interviews with customers and consumers and provide insight into the functions and features desired by them. Stories are then translated into tasks on the backlog to be developed by the team. Agile has many great practices and processes for development. Some that stand out to me are the product backlog, daily stand up, and sprint review. Being a good team member means supporting your team by accomplishing the tasks you set out to do, and communication. Communication is the most important as one miscommunication can potentially derail the project. 

CS 255 Systems Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Our client DriverPass requested a system to book driving lesson reservations. This could be done online, or through the provided contact number.

What did you do particularly well?

Something that went really well with this project was determining the various requirements needed. I feel as though many of the technical and functional requirements I provided were relevant and necessary for the system, taking into account the needs of the customer.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one thing that I really wanted was for my use case diagram to be more streamlined. I feel as though all of the information was necessary, but I struggled to organize it into a clean presentation. Next time I’ll take more time to order and rearrange the diagram to look neater.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting customer needs is an important part of designing any system. Particularly with DriverPass, we had a meeting and asked questions, and created a transcript. This was extremely helpful for creating system requirements. If a system doesn’t have what the client needs, It can’t be used as intended and is of little value.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

System design is an important part of creating a system because it dictates the growth and direction of development. Gathering requirements and the methods of gathering them are useful tools in addition to the design documents that give a visual representation of how the system should work.

CS 305 Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a company that managed financial accounts and had a cloud-based system that needed security. We provided secure communications and data encryption.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Finding vulnerabilities was difficult, but the dependency check made it easier. Secure code provides safety for customers and companies against breaches and data misuse. Lots of harm can be done to an unprotected system, and companies have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment for their customers.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Finding and identifying vulnerabilities was difficult, but as stated, the dependency check report made it simple to determine what needed to be looked at. Sometimes I had trouble determining false positives, but I did manage to learn to suppress them.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques? What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Adding message signing with SHA-256 and creating a certificate can be applied to any web-based system. Both of these techniques should be used as applicable. Standard coding and security should be observed for all future development.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran tests on the code and looked at examples for similar errors. Running the dependency check also showed new dependencies, but none were added by my refactoring.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

From this project, I would like to demonstrate the ability to add encryption algorithms and the ability to create certificates. I would also like to show my ability to refactor a codebase to determine and deal with vulnerabilities within a system.
